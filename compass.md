... or why I don't trust the political compass placements in the slightest.

(C) Palaiologos, 2021.

==[ 1. The political compass.

    The political compass is a simple device - people interested in politics
place themselves on the compass using various tests or self-assignment. Simply
put, it's a Cartesian coordinate system in which the ordinate values represent
the left and right (economical), and the abscissa represents authoritarianism
and liberalism. The political compass is better than the single-axis model,
which conveys less information by overgeneralization (authoritarian and liberal
right is represented as one; authoritarian and liberal left is represented as
one, while both of these pairs of placements significantly differ in ideals and
principles).

==[ 2. Uniaxial division.

    Let's continue talking about uniaxial division between the left and the
right. It's not only very hard to determine the location of an individual
person or ideology on it unambiguously, but also the resulting placement in
comparison isn't fruitful (it does not categorize ideas).

    Uniaxial division translates into the classic political compass in the
following way:

            [               Y ^              --  ]
            [                 |            -/    ]
            [                 |          -/      ]
            [                 |        -/        ]
            [                 |      -/          ]
            [                 |    -/            ]
            [                 |  -/              ]
            [                 |-/                ]
            [  ---------------/--------------->  ]
            [              -/ |               X  ]
            [            -/   |                  ]
            [          -/     |                  ]
            [        -/       |                  ]
            [      -/         |                  ]
            [    -/           |                  ]
            [  -/             |                  ]

    Liberalism is mostly connected with "the left", meanwhile authoritarianism
is usually connected with "the right", so uniaxial model is able to accurately
describe only entities going along f(n) = n in the biaxial model. This has an
intersting side effect. For instance, if we took a point which satisfies x < y,
the point can be mirrored along f(n) = n, yielding the same placement on the
uniaxial model.

    Simply put, a radically authoritarian left-leaning person, for instance,
P1(-0.1; 0.5), will be placed in the same spot on the uniaxial model as
P2(0.5; -0.1), a capitalist, libertarian-leaning person. Libertarian
capitalists (P2) share the same spot with totalitarians (P1), which doesn't
make sense in the slightest, because neither of them shares a fair part of ideals
and principles.

==[ 3. Hey, how about you come back to biaxial model?

    Right. Maybe i was too carried away? Or maybe we will need this knowledge
later? Either way, I don't like the political compass too, for a similiar
reason. No mathematical tricks or terms in this part.

    How exactly do we label the second (vertical) axis? There are two
approaches I've seen so far, and I think both of them don't make much sense.
First method of labeling that I'll crack on is `conservative / liberal`.
In this context, conservative means "favouring socially traditional ideas".
This definition, though, is inherently wrong as a label for the political
compass, because it's inherently context-sensitive. Assume two different
societies, each raised on a different continent. First society has been
traditionally built as on monarchist and religious values. The second society
gained it's traits via rebeling against the monarchist hegemony. The word
`conservative` in the first context means `supporting monarchist and religious
values`, and in the second context means `supporting freedom, democracy, and
state <=> religion separation`. `Liberal`, in turn, is a good term which
leaves no doubt about the person's alignment, because it's not bound to any
societal context, so both of these labels simply aren't antonyms of each other,
so they can't be considered antagonist (+ and -) on the political compass.
Simply put, we can't label the political compass's axes with two terms
`A` and `A or B, it depends`.

    I'll briefly ignore the fact that according to Oxford Languages, the
antonym of `conservative` is `socialist`, which is already reserved as a label
for one of the directions on the `x` axis, and accepting this definition would
yield the second dimension worthless.

    Now, we're left with the most popular way of labeling the axes, which is
`authoritarian / liberal`. This choice makes more sense, because `liberal`
seems to be an antonym of `authoritarian`, and both of these terms seem
mutually exculusive. I don't like this labelling either, which will bring me
upon the next point.

    Terms `authoritarian` and `liberal` sneakily introduce a dependency.
Dependency on the society and the authority in question, so, once again,
we're bumping our head on the problem the entire document was about, which is
inconsistency and ineffectivity in categorization. Supporters of
authoritarianism inherently believe that the society is unable to regulate
itself through liberal means, so there has to be some authority which will be
in charge of doing that. For example - a person that thinks that the society
(N.B.: subjective; the society A and society B as for example nationalities
might differ in values and viewpoints) can't regulate, for example, LGBTIQ+
rights on it's own. Maybe *-phobia is so rooted in this society, that it's
virtually impossible for it to regulate on it's own. Either way, the
authoritarian government decides to pass an act which guarantees equal rights
to LGBTIQ+ people and frowns upon any signs of discrimination. The act has
been enforced by an authoritarian government, but so it happens to overlap
with the liberal viewpoint, so we're at the paradox of tolerance once again,
where for one group to feel free, rights of other group to harm it must be
taken away.

    Let's look at this problem from a different perspective. Now, the
government, in a different society, takes a vastly different decision. An act
is passed which mandates LGBTIQ+ discrimination, and the person considering
themselves authoritarian decides that the society can't regulate itself and
an stop harming values it used to hold.

    Once again, we stumble upon the same problem. And it's not the problem with
liberalism. An authoritarian person can hold the same view as a liberal person.
So what is the difference between them? Why, although their goals are
isomorphic, should they be split into two parts? Why a person describing
themselves as authoritarian is placed in the same place on the political
compass as the person with vastly different views?

==[ 4. The compass is imprecise? We already knew that.

    The compass isn't only imprecise. It doesn't make sense on a larger scale.
A group of people from different backgrounds can be placed next to each other
on the political compass, and hold drastically different views. The compass,
simply put, sucks.

==[ 5. What's a good, objective, external-factor independent measure then?

    I don't know. There have been attempts of multi-axis placements, and
they're probably the best so far. The only immediately obvious way of stating
your viewpoints is simply.. expressing them. A good way of grouping people
by their viewpoints is collecting their stances on modern-day problems the
society faces, which reduces the ambiguity to the minimum.

==[ 6. Political tests.

    Political tests are inherently astrology for people who don't believe in
astrology. They start in a very noble way - asking the participant about their
opinions about contemporary problems, but they end up ruining the entire test
by oversimplifying and committing the generalised post hoc ergo propter hoc
fallacy (because most authoritarian respondents answered `yes` to this question
this will increase your score towards authoritarianism).

    Political tests, in my opinion, would be much better off being a
questionnaire which doesn't do result interpretation. This problem becomes very
obvious for uniaxial tests (you support competition on the market => points
towards right, you deny LGBTIQ rights => points towards right), creating
correlations where they shouldn't be.

==[ 7. Closing words

    That's it. I don't know a good solution to the problem, and that's a
few cents I chip to the topic, 'till the next time.
