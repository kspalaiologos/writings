# writings
a single place to collectively store every bit of my writings i deem at least remotely valuable.

index:
 * [Cracking a PRNG on the example of Mersenne Twister](p1.md) (_originally and ideally available on [my website](http://palaiologos.rocks/?id=9), but due to OVH incidents it's temporarily unavailable_).
 * [A O(1) solution to the matrix diagonal sum finding problem](pe28.pdf) (_originally located in the euler-apl repository_).
 * [Seed Turing-completeness](tc-seed.pdf) (_written in 2019, "fixed" in 2021, originally hosted in a separate repository_).
 * [(Polish) Various string algorithms, puzzle proofs and solutions](tasks.pfg) (_made originally as a course-entry submission_).
 * [Implementing functional devices using SKI calculus](ski.pdf) (_originally published on my website in 2020, doesn't star the most optimal snippets_).
 * [(Puzzle) Smallest infinite fibonacci program in C - 167 bytes](fib.c) (_originally made in collaboration with Ada; published on my website in 2020_).
