# writings
a single place to collectively store every bit of my writings i deem at least remotely valuable.

index:
 * [Cracking a PRNG on the example of Mersenne Twister](p1.md) (_originally and ideally available on [my website](palaiologos.rocks/?id=9), but due to OVH incidents it's temporarily unavailable_).
 * [A O(1) solution to the matrix diagonal sum finding problem](p2.pdf) (_originally located in the euler-apl repository_).
